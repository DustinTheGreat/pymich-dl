Things to talk about

- visualization
http://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/conv/

- machine learning: how do we use statistics to make a simple decision (simple output) based on a complex situation (complex input)
   - self-driving cars
   - detecting cancer in body scans
   - classifying music

- deep learning: machine learning using an artifical neural network (ann) with many layers (usually processed on a GPU for massive paralellism)

- The dogs/cats python notebook

WARNING: This has been the briefest overview. You need more depth to really grok this stuff.
