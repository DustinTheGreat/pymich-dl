Outline for 2019-10-02 PyMichana Talk

Followup:
- ComputerVision Reneissance
- Spotify Genres
- Google Doodle: Music style transfer (Bach style)
- Generative Adversarial Networks
- Activation Functions Explanation
- Mutual Information Research (open research)
- WaveNet
- PyTorch vs. Keras

- [cnn visualization](https://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/conv/)
   - machine learning: how do we use statistics (and software) to make a simple decision (simple output) based on a complex situation (complex input)
      - detecting music genres (audio classification)
      - placing images into categories (image classification)
         - detecting cancer in body scans
      - self-driving cars (reinforcement learning)
   - learning uses a lot of data
      - each eye is transmitting around [10 megabits per second](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2006/july/penn-researchers-calculate-how)
      - the imagenet dataset has over [14 million images](http://www.image-net.org/)
      - typical "comfortable" use for a private dataset would be about 100,000 images
      - you need lots of data to make your machine learning project successful
   - deep learning: machine learning using an artifical neural network (ann) with many layers (usually processed on a GPU for massive paralellism)

- [dogs/cats python notebook](https://github.com/jeyoor/pymich-dl/blob/master/dogs_and_cats_functional.ipynb)
   - talk about collaboratory
   - show the Keras code setting up the neural network
   - talk about using sklearn-metrics and confusion matrices for evaluation

- [More details on Convolutional Neural Networks](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner's-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/)
   - [what's a convolution?](https://machinelearninguru.com/computer_vision/basics/convolution/image_convolution_1.html)

WARNING: This has been the briefest overview. You need more depth to really grok this stuff.
